Safari Sprint is an auto-runner game where you must avoid obstacles and deadly animals
if you wish to make it back alive! Players can jump, duck, and shoot in order to avoid
certain death and rack up score. See how long you can survive in the deadly wilderness!

Controls: Spacebar to jump, "S" key to duck, Mouse to aim and Left-click to shoot.
