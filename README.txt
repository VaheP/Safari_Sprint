Safari Sprint is an auto-runner game where you must avoid obstacles and deadly animals
if you wish to make it back alive! Players can jump, duck, and shoot in order to avoid
certain death and rack up score. See how long you can survive in the deadly wilderness!

Controls: Spacebar to jump, "S" key to duck, Mouse to aim and Left-click to shoot.

NOTE: On running the file and encountering a white box, press "P" to start or "Q" to quit;
the box is an issue with the GameStart sprite asset that will be fixed by the final build. 
It is only a visual bug and does not impact gameplay whatsoever.
